You are free to ask questions
you are allowed to question if you have a better and a cheaper solution

Intro

	Motivation for building the app

The initial protoype on salesforce
Why salesforce
	I am a salesforce developer 
	
Principles 

	Solve the fundamental problem	Connect people together
	Responsive design 
	Must be based google maps
	Simplify user onboarding
	Collect minimal information 
	Less intervention from people who are offering ride
	
	Great we need GMaps API to begin with
		Google Maps Directions API
		Google Maps Distance Matrix API 4
		Google Maps Geocoding API
	
	What all services do we need from API
		Geocoding service
		Reverse geocoding
		Directions service (complex)
		Travel modes in directions
		Waypoints in directions
		Draggable directions
		Distance Matrix service
		Place autocomplete
		ETC ETC
		
	Now I realise I dont anything about Google Maps API!
		
	Anyway I started
	3 Pages
		Login
		Details of person who is offering the ride
		Search for rides
		
	Priority
		1) Capture information of person who is offering ride
		2) Develop the search page
		3) Login page
		
	Started with capturing infomation, related to person who is offering the ride
	Iteration 1: Click some landmarks along your route fill in your details and save
		
		Showed this to rohan - I got excellent feedback - ITS STUPID !!
		
		Yes! I accept Its a stupid solution 
		But a good starting point though
		users might mark on the wrong side of the road, handle this
		
	Iteration 2 : Integrated with Places API Service
				  Made maps fill up the whole page
				  UI changes (My details under collapseable side bar)
				  Ability to have multiple routes
		
		Showed this to rohan - I got excellent feedback - Now its acceptable
		
	Now that we had completed (almost) the capturing user info part, we moved on to search rides module
	
	Iteration 1: Just the UI
				 Clicking anywhere on the map and hit search
				 Show the information people who are going near that point
	
				
	The Searching problem !!
	How do we search ??!!
		
	There is no Google maps api to search :P
	
	We need to build our own
	
	1st solution
	Trying out brute force algorithms
	For all the people offering rides
	Point 1 office 
	Point 2 user destination
	Point 3 Driver destination
	
	Calculate distance between Point 1 and 3 
	Calculate the distance between Point 1 and 3 passing through point 2
	Take the difference 
	sort as per the least deviation
	
	This time I dint show anything to rohan for obvious reasons
	
	By this time you Computer science guys among us might have realised this is a typical TSP
	
	Travelling salesman problem - NP Complete
	
	Explaing TSP ----TO DO-----
	
	Our case - TSP without the weights just the nodes
	
	--LESSONS IN LIFE WILL BE REPEATED UNTIL THEY ARE LEARNED--
	
	Only way to solve NP Complete problem is by doing all or some of the below points
	
	
	Approximation
	Randomization
	Parameterization
	Restriction: By restricting the structure of the input , faster algorithms are usually possible.
	
	This was the most crucial part in solving the problem
	RESTRICTION
	
	What do we restrict and how do we restrict?
		
	I came up with a simple but an effective solution
		
	Putting markers approximately everymile along the route,
	so that whenever the user searches we can calculate the proximity
	But challenge
	Google API allows only 8 way points(markers) between origin and destination.
	
	Somehow we were able to overcome this problem.
	Simple search was through Haversine's distance
	
	intergrated with UI
	this was the output
	
	The evolution of UI
	Somehow I was not comfortable with my details user information
	after design changes this is how it looked
	
	-- put screenshot --
	
	designed the login page and registration page
	
	-- put screenshot --
	
	18-09-2016 The development box was created
	21-10-2016 Fully functional app was ready on salesforce
	
	I had other regular project to work on as well, 
	this was developed whenever i got some free time.
	
	I did a demo to couple of guys.
	
	Everyone's feedback had a similar theme.
	
	
	Bosses: Great app this is much required,when can we make this live?
	Me: Can you sponsor ap hosting cost
	Bosses: Bye!
	
	I left it there, 
	I did my job
	
	Somehow I pursued this a lot (one of the very few things in life I pursued.)
		
	
	-- You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it --
	The journey from a Protoype to Solution
	
	I started exploring alternate techologies which would be cheaper to run

which tech
	all accounts right from heroku,aws,azure,mongo,droplet,stamplay etc etc 
	evaluation of firebase
	intro to serverless
	mindfk
	took 2 months

Grand vision


Be able to build things

We are moving from producers to consumers
It was really sad among the 20+ people I met in the IT hub were all non technical
I couldnt find people who have worked on NOSQL databases
THE PROBLEM
	
	People dont who stays ;


When you live for a strong purpose, hardwork is not an option but necessary

To be able to sacrifice what you are to what you become

Mention list of blog posts went through

If you could have you would have

No questions on technology stack, 
you are allowed to ask a question if you think your proposal will be cheaper than 10$ to run unlimited users

Its never a technical challenge (ofcourse its difficult problem to solve TSP)

Not a booking platform

In programming the hard part isnt solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve
to be able to sacrifice what you are

apps are greedy, apps are meant to display ads



three principles
	cheap to run 
	zero maintainance
	zero admin/operation tasks
	experimental features
	data transer minimal=========
	
	I am the boss
	
	If i can change you can change everyone can change - rocky
	
	Less than 10$ per month at peak usage
